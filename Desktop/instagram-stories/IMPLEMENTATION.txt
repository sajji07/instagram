# Instagram Stories Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This is a fully functional Instagram-like Stories feature built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It includes server-side rendering (SSR), static generation, SEO optimization with Open Graph tags, and client-side session storage for view tracking.

- **Server-side rendering**: For better SEO

## Data Schema

### User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  name: string;
  avatar: string;
}
```

### Story
```typescript
interface Story {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  user: User;
  type: 'image' | 'video';
  media: string;
  caption?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  expiresAt: string;
  viewCount: number;
  viewedBy: string[];
  duration?: number;
}
```

### StoryGroup
```typescript
interface StoryGroup {
  user: User;
  stories: Story[];
  hasViewed: boolean;
  unviewedCount: number;
}
```

## Session Storage Usage

The app uses Session Storage to track which stories have been viewed during the session:

```json
{
  "story1": ["currentUser"],
  "story2": ["currentUser"],
  "story3": ["currentUser", "user2", "user3"]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- View data persists during the session
- No backend required for demo
- Resets when tab/browser is closed
- Easy to implement real backend view tracking

## Hardcoded Data

The app comes with 6 stories from 4 users with realistic data:
- Multiple images per user
- Captions and view counts
- Timestamps
- Pre-populated view lists

To modify stories, edit `src/data/stories.ts`.

## Running the App

### Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Server runs at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (Turbopack for fast builds)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Storage**: Session Storage API
- **Routing**: Next.js Pages Router with dynamic routes

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**: Using standard img tags with Unsplash CDN
2. **Code Splitting**: Automatic via Next.js
3. **Static Generation**: Story pages are pre-generated at build time
4. **Revalidation**: ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) set to 60s
5. **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on-demand

## Customization

### Change Story Duration
In `StoryViewer.tsx`, modify the `duration` prop (default: 5 seconds)

### Add New Stories
Edit `src/data/stories.ts` and add to the `stories` array

### Modify Colors
Update Tailwind classes in components, especially:
- `StoriesList.tsx`: Story ring gradients
- `StoryViewer.tsx`: Progress bar and UI colors

### Add More Users
Update the `users` object in `src/data/stories.ts`

## Future Enhancements

- Backend integration for persistent view tracking
- User authentication and personal story creation
- Video story support with proper controls
- Story filters and effects
- Share stories to other platforms
- Analytics dashboard
- Real-time notifications for viewers

## Notes

- All images are from Unsplash and are sample URLs
- View tracking is session-based (resets on page refresh)
- Stories expire after 24 hours (in real implementation)
- The app is fully responsive and mobile-friendly
